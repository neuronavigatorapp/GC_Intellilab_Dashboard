    "Intro to Gas Chromatography": "GC separates volatile compounds using a carrier gas and a temperature-controlled column.",
    "FID Basics": "Flame Ionization Detectors respond to carbon-containing compounds by producing ions in a hydrogen flame.",
    "Tailing Causes": "Peak tailing can result from column overloading, active sites, or poor injection technique.",
    "Backflush Logic": "Backflushing directs heavier compounds out of the system post-run, preventing contamination of the column or detector.",
    "Split Ratio Impact": "Changing the split ratio affects sample amount entering the column — higher splits mean less sample, better peak shape."
